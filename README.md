# assembly_scaffold_BLAST

This program is designed to assemble paired end reads deterministically,
and assigning fourmer frequency weights to the assembled paired end R1 and R2 read sequences.

Then, scaffolds are assembled by weighted debruijn processes. 

The resulting alignments are used as BLAST queries.
